               <h2>Our Meetings</h2>
               </br>
               <p> We try our best to schedule in a meeting every week so that our members are able to have an
                  abundant amount of time to work on their projects. These meetings are typically every Friday during lunch
                  in room 15 (which is in our school's basement). At the start of the meetings, we tend to go over
                  important information about conferences, fundraisers, and plans for the upcoming weeks, while also
                  reminding everyone to work on their projects. We make most of these meetings optional because we
                  understand that students tend to use lunch time to ask other teachers for help in particular subjects,
                  but we highly encourage them to attend the meetings because this will give them at least 30 minutes to work
                  on the porjects during school, rather than having to complete it all at home.

               <h2>Recruiting for the Club</h2>
               </br>
               <p>Most of our recruiting happens at the beginning of the year during our school's
                  club expo and freshman picnic. For the freshmen picnic, we had set up our poster (pictured on the right)
                  on a table outside of the school. We interacted with many of the freshmen and explained to them why they should join TSA.
                  For club expo, this event was open to all students at Wootton during lunch mid-September. We used the same poster in hopes
                  of convincing more students to join TSA. However, just because students don't sign up during these two events doesn't mean
                  that they can't be a member. We're always looking for new members and we're happy to
                  welcome anyone anytime during the school year! This year, our chapter has 11 members, which is a slight increase from
                  last year. With each upcoming year, our goal is to continue expanding membership and recognition of TSA in our school.
                  If you know anyone at Wootton who is interested in joining TSA, please tell them to contact wootton.tsa@gmail.com.

               <h2>Our Future Plans</h2>
               </br>
               <p>We hope that in the upcoming years, we are able to spread TSA to other MCPS schools, ecspecially to both
                  Robert Frost Middle School and Cabin John Middle School, in addition to increasing club participation at
                  our own school. We want to provide other schools in our community the same opportunity that TSA provided
                  us. Using TSA as a platform, we want to show other students that STEM is something
                  that everyone can do and can enjoy doing.
